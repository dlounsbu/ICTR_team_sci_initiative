My name is David Lounsbury, and it is my privilege and my pleasure to Chair our opening plenary session for the Health Thread, “Disrupting the Status Quo: Revolutionizing Population Health in the Face of Change.” 

I am an Associate Professor of Epidemiology and Population Health and Associate Director of Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Training at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. 

Einstein is located in the Bronx, which typically ranks as the New York City borough with the highest rates of poverty, morbidity, and violence. And as the shock of the COVID pandemic illustrated so painfully in 2020, our research in health systems must stay centered on the challenge of designing and sustaining a truly socially responsible, responsive, high quality health care system, and to do so in solidarity with the vibrant, diverse, complex communities that are the patient populations we serve.

The formidable body of work that each of our plenary speakers is about to describe for us today – each through a different, yet complimentary lens – offer strategies that system dynamics to meet this challenge.

As a community-psychologist and a psycho-oncologist with expertise in system dynamics modeling, I understand the limitations of reductionist research approaches in clinical and population health research. 

We need ecologically-grounded data science methodologies for synthesizing the tsunami of information that are contemporary electronic health care systems generate, methodologies that emphasize an epistemology of participatory action, with the aim of engaging diverse stakeholders in co-development and validation of  computational tools that inform effective solutions to complex problems in health and health care delivery, which includes how best to implement and sustain them over time.

<b>Bobby Milstein</b>, our first panelist, will reflect expressly on this challenge, referring to his work at CDC and with ReThink Health.  A central aim, for Bobby, is to build and disseminate models that reflect stakeholders’ priorities and that are grounded in their expertise and lived experience. By applying system dynamics in this way, we can more readily build capacity in teaching systems thinking skills to community leaders who are key change agents. 

Next, with a focus on building and sustaining high performing health systems at the national level, Dr. David Matchar will describe his work for Singapore, where he has built a program of research using systems dynamics to examine ways to improve population health, enhance patient experience, and to reduce per capita costs of care (the so-called ‘triple aim’), to which he and his associates have added a fourth aim which he brands ‘good provider life.’ 

Finally, we will hear from Douglas Mc McKelvie and Eric Wolstenholme. They have applied systems archetypes to inform models that for the UK health system that demonstrate the necessity of integrating social care with hospital care. Their approach is transdisciplinary, team-based, and collaborative, and employs mixed methods research designs, that are robustly systems-oriented and multi-leveled. 

<b>So, now, allow me to specifically introduce our first speaker</b>.

<b>Bobby Milstein</b> brings a multidisciplinary background in cultural anthropology, behavioral science, and systems science to his on-going work at Rippel Foundation, which is an organization long-dedicated to building institutional capacity for innovative change in health care leadership. 

At the Rippel Foundation, Bobby currently serves as Director of System Strategy.  

Prior to joining the Rippel Foundation, Bobby was based at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, where he championed a variety of systems change projects in public health.

Bobby is currently a Visiting Scientist at the MIT Sloan School of Management. He is a member of the National Academies Roundtable on Population Health Improvement and he is also Lead Editor of the Springboard for Thriving Together theatre project. 

The title of his presentation is: <b>What Does it Take to be Good Stewards of the Systems that Shape Our Lives Together?</b>

Q: How might the Society partner with you to help meet the demand to train and deploy community leaders? 

<b>Next we have Dr. David Matchar.</b>

Dr. Matchar, is the Inaugural Director of the <b>Program in Health Services and Systems Research at National Singapore University.</b> He is also Professor of Medicine at Duke University in the United States. He is a leading economic and policy analyst to the Singapore Clinical Genomics Program and he is consultant to the Ministry of Health National Initiative for Healthcare Transformation.

He has worked in clinical research for over 35 years; his work primarily relates to stroke and other chronically disabling neurological disorders.

He served as Director of the Duke Center for Clinical Health Policy Research and he established the Duke Evidence-based Practice Center, which was responsible for analyses that informed policies of the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and that supported guidelines for various medical professional societies.

The title of Dr. Matchar’s presentation is: <b>Systems Modeling to Support National Healthcare Systems Change: Experience in Singapore</b>

Q: How is this work generalizable to other populations, other countries? 

<b>Our last presentation today will be given by Douglas McKelvie and Eric Wolstenholme, who is joining us on-line.</b> 

<b>Douglas McKelvie</b> has had a varied career, starting as a social worker in 1980. In the 1990s, he worked for the UK regulator of social work education, where his responsibilities included workforce development and planning, whilst further studies introduced him to modelling and simulation. In 2002, he moved into consultancy working alongside Eric Wolstenholme, who supervised his apprenticeship in System Dynamics.

Douglas is a past President of both the UK Chapter and the Health Policy SIG of the SDS and has written about the use of simulation in health, social care, and related human services. He lives in Edinburgh and works across the UK (sometimes beyond).

<b>Professor Eric Wolstenholme</b> holds a Bachelor of Science degree and Doctorate in Engineering from Nottingham University UK and a Master’s degree in Operational Research from Brunel University UK. 

He worked in Operational Research for British Coal and was Head of the first System Dynamics Research Group in the UK at Bradford University Business School. He subsequently held full Professorial posts at Stirling, Leeds Beckett and London South Bank Universities in Management Science and Business Learning as well as helping to establish and direct two management consultancies in System Dynamics - <b>Cognitus and Symmetric.</b> 

He was a founding member of the System Dynamics Society, its fourth President and the Founding Editor of the System Dynamics Review. He has written three books and a wide range of peer-reviewed research articles in System Dynamics. In 2004 received the Jay Wright Forrester Award for his work on generic systems archetypes.

And their talk is entitled: <b>Tackling Multi-Sector Problems with System Dynamics: Exploring Whole Systems Solutions to Support Health and Social Care</b>

Q: Are any of the archetypes described by Eric actually in the model described by Douglas?
