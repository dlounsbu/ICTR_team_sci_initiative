## BEST HEALTH SD PAPER BY AN EARLY CAREER RESEARCHER AWARD ANNOUNCEMENT

Good afternoon and greetings to all. 

My name is David Lounsbury, and I am <b>Committee Chair for the 2024 Best Early Career Health Paper Award</b>. 

This award is organized by the <b>Health Policy Special Interest Group</b> of the System Dynamics Society.

The Award is given to <b> outstanding system dynamics papers </b> authored by a student or by a recent graduate that focus on <b> health or public health topics. </b>

The <b> Early Career Health Paper Award</b> was previously sponsored by the Lupina Foundation of Canada, but is now sponsored directly by the Health Policy SIG. 

This year, through contributions made by Committee Members themselves, we are offering a <b>$25-hundred dollar cash prize to the winner</b> and a <b>$500 cash prize for honorable mention</b> to first runner up. 

I want to thank this <b>year’s Committee Members</b> for ALL of their support and for their expert review of all submitted papers.

So, this year, our <b>Best Early Career Health Paper Award</b> goes to Ann Osigh of Virginia Tech for her paper entitled: 

<b>A Simultaneous Simulation of Human Behavior Dynamics and Epidemic Spread: A Multi-Country Study Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic</b>

[Ann, please join me UP HERE NOW]

Ann is currently a <b>Doctoral Candidate in Industrial and Systems Engineering at Virginia Tech</b>

Her research focuses on <b>behavioral epidemiology modeling</b> as a strategy to inform effective public health decision-making and improve population health outcomes.

Notably, Ann was also last year’s recipient of the <b>Dana Meadows Award.</b>

We congratulate Ann and her primary mentor, Prof Navid, for ALL for their success and we thank them for their continued contributions to the field.

And our <b>Honorable Mention</b> goes to Fatin Aminah Binti Hassan for her paper entitled:

<b>Impacts of Salt Intake Reduction Interventions on Medical and Long-term Care Costs in Japan</b>

[Fatin, please come up with us, now, too]

Fatin is currently a postdoctoral researcher at <b>Japan's National Institute of Health and Nutrition .</b> 

Fatin received her PhD in <b>Technology Management from Japan's Ritsu-mei-KAN University,</b> where she quickly developed excellent skills in System Dynamics modeling.

Fatin’s current research focuses on building <b>System Dynamics Models</b> to analyze the health and economic impacts of various population health initiatives in Japan. 

<b>Congratulations</b> to you, Fatin, and to all of your mentors.
