## BEST HEALTH SD PAPER BY AN EARLY CAREER RESEARCHER AWARD ANNOUNCEMENT

Good afternoon and greetings to all. 

My name is David Lounsbury and I am <b>Chair of the Committee for the 2024 Best Early Career Health Paper Award</b>. 

This award is organized by the <b>Health Policy Special Interest Group</b> of the System Dynamics Society and is given to outstanding system dynamics papers authored by a student or by recent graduates that focus on health or public health topics. 

The Early Career Health Paper Award was previously sponsored by the Lupina Foundation of Canada, but is now sponsored directly by the Health Policy SIG. 

To be eligible, applicants must be matriculated in a graduate research program or have completed their graduate or post-graduate research training within the past 5 years. 
And their papers must also be accepted for presentation at the conference. 

This year, through contributions made by the Early Career Committee Members themselves, we are offering a <b>$25-hundred dollar cash prize to the winner</b> and a <b>$500 cash prize for honorable mention</b> to first runner up. 

I want to thank this <b>year’s Committee Members</b> for ALL of their support and for their expert review of all submitted papers.

So, this year, our <b>Best Early Career Health Paper Award</b> goes to Ann Osi of Virginia Tech for her paper entitled: 

<b>A Simultaneous Simulation of Human Behavior Dynamics and Epidemic Spread: A Multi-Country Study Amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic</b>

[Ann, please join me UP HERE NOW]

Ann is currently a <b>Doctoral Candidate in Industrial and Systems Engineering at Virginia Tech</b.>

Her research focuses on <b>behavioral epidemiology modeling<\b> as a strategy to inform more effective public health decision-making and to improve health outcomes and promote better healthcare policies. 

Notably, Ann was also last year’s recipient of the <b>Dana Meadows Award.<\b>

We congratulate Ann and her primary mentor, Dr. Navid <b>Ghaf-FAR-ZA-DE-GAN</b> for ALL for their success and thank them for their continued contributions to the field.

And our <b>Honorable Mention</b> goes to Fatin Aminah Binti Hassan of the <b>National Institute of Technology, based in Osaka, Japan,</b> for her paper entitled:

<b>Impacts of Salt Intake Reduction Interventions on Medical and Long-term Care Costs in Japan</b>

[Fatin, please come up with us, now, too]

Fatin is currently a postdoctoral researcher at the <b>National Institute of Health and Nutrition.</b> 

Fatin received her PhD in <b>Technology Management from Rit-su-mei-kan University,</b> where she developed an interest in System Dynamics and applied this method to her healthcare research.

Fatin’s current research focuses on building <b>System Dynamics Models</b> to analyze the health and economic effects of salt consumption reduction among Japanese populations at both national and prefectural levels. 

<b>Congratulations</b> to you, Fatin, and to all of your mentors.
