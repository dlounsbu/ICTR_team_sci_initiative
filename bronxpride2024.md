At the podium with Dr.Raj Perihoit from Mount Sinai.

You will go up together prior to the 2:50 time slot.

**[Greeting: Start with a Personal Story]**

Good afternoon, everyone! 

It’s incredible to see so many beautiful faces gathered here today!

All of us coming together to celebrate pride, love, and UNITY in our vibrant LGBTQ Bronx community.

**[Addressing LGBTQ Health Disparities]**

I want to thank Appalonia and Rev. Carmen Hernandez for inviting me to the podium today.

Let’s take a moment to talk about how important it is to make sure that we are supporting each other’s health. 

**How can we do that?**

One very important way to support **your** health and **your LGBTQ friends’ and family’s health** is to make sure everyone has, and ideally loves, their primary care provider.

At Einstein, my research aims to find ways to partner with primary care doctors and other health care providers to find ways of helping the community be healthier. 

Over the years, much of my research has addressed issues concerning cancer care and HIV care issues. 

We know that these diseases touch many of us in the LGBTQ community. 

I am a prostate cancer survivor, now 13 years cancer free, actually. 

Finding out that I had cancer was a total surprise. 

If it had not been for my own excellent primary care provider, a gay man himself who at that time was running a small, but very busy practice in Chelsea for nearly exclusively LGBTQ patients, I might very well not be here today. 

Regular cancer screenings save lives. Period. 

Many types of cancer, when caught early, are highly treatable. 

Yet, LGBTQ individuals are less likely to receive recommended preventive screenings due to a variety of barriers – from discrimination in healthcare settings to a lack of culturally competent care. 

We need to find ways to change that. 

We need to provide more resources and support to overcome potential stigma or discrimination in healthcare settings.

We need to make health care more affordable and offer information on financial assistance programs for those who are underinsured or uninsured.

And, of course, we need to create supportive and non-judgmental environments where we feel safe as LGBTQ patients, and where we feel inspired to take proactive steps in our own healthcare.

Here are some facts I want to share with you about cancer risk for LGBTQ persons:

Did you know that studies show that too many of us smoke and vape in the LGBTQ community? 

And that lesbians and bisexual women, in particular, have higher smoking rates, increasing their risk for lung cancer and other cancers, including breast cancer?

And what about HPV-Related Cancers? 

We know that certain strains of Human papillomavirus (HPV) are associated with cervical cancers in women and, in men who have sex with men (MSM), with anal and throat cancers. 

The good news is that we have a highly efficacious HPV vaccination, which is recommeded for all LGBTQ people, especially for our LGBTQ youths and MSM up to the age of 26.

Breast and cervical cancer: We know that LGBTQ women may avoid gynecologic exams and screenings due to discrimination, potentially increasing their risk for undetected breast and cervical cancers.

Again, the solution is finding a primary care provider who is knowledgeable and sensitive to your needs. 

And this is what we working for:

Making sure that healthcare settings are welcoming and inclusive, as studies show that clinics that are more welcoming and inclusive truly impact the willingness of LGBTQ individuals to seek preventive care and screenings.

This is where I want to mention DISRUPT. 

DISRUPT is an on-going project that is changing the way cancer research is supported at major New York medical academic centers, including Montefiore Medical Center, Mt. Sinai, and Columbia University. 

DISRUPT's focus is on Black and Latinx communities in the Bronx, Washington Heights, East Harlem and Central Harlem. 

DISRUPT stands for DIVERSITY & INCLUSION IN RESEARCH UNDERPINNING PREVENTION & THERAPY TRIALS. 

DISRUPT is all about community and unity. 

We seek to increase access to high quality cancer care and we are supporting new ways to promote participation in cancer clincal trails, within the LGBTQ community and beyond, through targeted education and outreach programs.

This is the work that Rev. Carmen Hernandez and others are doing, and we are so grateful to her and to our other community programming co-designers. Thank you Rev. Carmen.

**[Routine HIV Testing for Black and Latinx LGBTQ Youth]**

Another critical health issue that demands our attention is routine HIV testing and access to HIV prevention medication, or PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis), especially for our Black and Latinx LGBTQ youth. 

The reality is stark: young Black and Latinx gay and bisexual men and transgender individuals are most at risk of HIV in the Bronx. 

They are many times more likely to become HIV+ than any other group in our community.

Routine HIV testing and PrEP are powerful preventive tools in our fight against HIV/AIDS. 

Knowing our status empowers us to take control of our health, whether that means accessing treatment or taking preventive measures like PrEP.

To our young Black and Latinx LGBTQ folks: You are powerful. You are resilient. And your health matters. 

Make an appt today with a primary care provider and make routine HIV testing a regular part of your healthcare routine. 

Don't be afraid to ask for it, and don’t be afraid to talk openly with your partners and friends about it.

To help meet this need in the Bronx, I am happy to announce that my Montifiore colleague Dr. Jonthan Ross and I have just been awarded a brand new grant 5-year grant from the National Institutes of Health. 

This study will work in partnership with the Bronx LGBTQ community to find ways to scale up access to PrEP for our Black and Latino LGBTQ youth. 

I am so excited about this project, which will engage community expertise from:

•	The Latino Commission on AIDS

•	Destination Tomorrow

•	PrEP4All 

•	The Montefiore Department of Community and Population Health

•	Our Center for AIDS Research at Einstein, CUNY and Rockefeller AND

•	The Bronx Borough President’s Office

**[Call to Action]**

Today, let’s make a promise to ourselves and each other – to prioritize our health and well-being. 

Let’s support and advocate for one another, ensuring that our healthcare providers understand our unique needs and treat us with the respect and dignity we deserve.

We need to push for inclusive healthcare services, demand education and awareness campaigns that focus on our community, and support COMMUNITY RESEARCH that partners with organizations that work tirelessly for our health and rights.

If you want to learn more or if you want to support either our DISRUPT Cancer Project or our PrEP HIV Prevention Project, please call me! 

Thank you, and happy Pride, Bronx!
